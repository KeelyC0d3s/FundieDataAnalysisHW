# FundieDataAnalysisHW


This readme file contains my practical task assignments for my Fundamentals of Data Analysis class.

The tasks are as follows:

Task 1: 
Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} .

Task 2: 
Write a Python function called dicerolls that simulates rolling dice. Your function should take two parameters: the number of dice k and the number of times to roll the dice n. The function should simulate randomly rolling k dice n times, keeping track of each total face value. It should then return a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred.

Task 3: 
Write some python code that simulates flipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve. You should explain your work in a Markdown cell above the code. The numpy.random.binomial function can be used to simulate flipping a coin with a 50/50 chance of heads or tails.

Task 4: 
Simpson’s paradox is a well-known statistical paradox where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined into one big data set. 

Use numpy to create four data sets, each with an x array
and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox. 

You might create your x arrays using numpy.linspace and create the y array for each
x using notation like y = a * x + b where you choose the a and b for each
x , y pair to demonstrate the paradox. 


All tasks are contained within a Jupyter Notebook.

How to Run the Jupyter Notebook:

1) Open the terminal on your Mac or PC
2) Navigate to the folder where your project is stored
3) Type Jupyter Notebook and press ‘Enter’
4) A browser will appear that will show a .ipynb document
5) Double-click on the .ipynb document and another tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook
6) Begin reading/working in your Jupyter Notebook
